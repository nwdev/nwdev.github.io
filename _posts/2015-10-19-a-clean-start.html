  <h4>So yeah the blog sucks right now</h4>
  <p>The jekyll boilerplate is great, but since I am new to jekyll, web design and blogging in general, I think the most 
  beneficial way to do this is to start from scratch.</p>
  <p>Hopefully, in a few <del>weeks</del> days, this blog will have at least a basic layout.</p>
  <p>Anyway, let's do it cheers!</p>

    So one of my friend suggested that I keep a snapshot of the blog for every post regarding changes to the site, this way everyone can see how the site transforms from one state to the other.
