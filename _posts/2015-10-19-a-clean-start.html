<h4>So yeah the blog sucks right now</h4>
<p>The jekyll boilerplate is great, but since I am new to jekyll, web design and blogging in general, I think the most 
beneficial way to do this is to start from scratch.</p>
<p>Hopefully, in a few <del>weeks</del> days, this blog will have at least a basic layout.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's do it cheers!</p>
